    <p class="aboutMe">
      My name Tate Frost and I am a software engineer who is eager and ready to learn everything and anything software! I am devoted to python development, specifically back end web development, however I am also very intrigued by cyber security and cryptography. I have worked in fast food and factories and am ready to make a change, I am currently working closely with and looking for work in python based web applications utilizing flask and eventually I would like to work in the world of cryptocurrencies/blockchains which are all subjects I am passionate about.
      </p>
    <p class ="aboutMe">    In my spare time, I love to do anything and everything that has to do with music. I love to play the guitar amongst other instruments, and I am currently in the process of publishing my personally written music. I am also very passionate about personal finances and motor vehicles, and enjoy spending the time when I have it!</p>
