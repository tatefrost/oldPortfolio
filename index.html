      About me 
    </h3>
    <p class="aboutMe">    My name is Tate Frost and I am an eager software engineer in Salt Lake City, Utah. I am devoted to python development, specifically back end web development, however I am also very intrigued by cyber security and cryptography. I have worked in fast food and factories and am ready to make a change, I am currently attending DevMountain in hopes of working closely in the future with python back end based web applications and eventually working in the world of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain which are all subjects I am passionate about.</p>
    <p class ="aboutMe">    In my spare time, I love to do anything and everything that has to do with music. I love to play the guitar amongst other instruments, and I am currently in the process of publishing my personally written music. I am also very passionate about personal finances and motor vehicles, and enjoy spending the time when I have it!</p>
